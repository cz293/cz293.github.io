### About Me
I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics (LSGI), The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU). Prior to joining PolyU, I was a Senior Research Associate at the University of East Anglia (United Kingdom).

My research tries to explore complex dynamic urban systems through big data analysis and agent-based modelling. This involves several urban sub-systems, including transportation, land use, environment, energy, economy and population systems. Recently, I am particularly interested in the diffusion and impacts of emerging transportation technologies (e.g., shared autonomous electric vehicles). Specific research topics include: 

•	Smart Mobility (e.g., E-Mobility, Autonomous Mobility and Shared Mobility) 

•	Spatial Big Data Analysis and Modelling

•	Activity-based Travel Demand Modelling

•	Land Use and Transport Integrated Modelling

•	Large-Scale Urban Micro-simulation 

For those researchers (e.g., PhD students and post-docs) who want to join my team, please feel free to contact me (chengxiang.zhuge@polyu.edu.hk) with your CV included.
