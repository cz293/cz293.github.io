### About Me
I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics (LSGI), The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU). Prior to joining PolyU, I was a Senior Research Associate at the University of East Anglia (United Kingdom).
I got my Bachelor and first Doctoral degrees in Transportation from the Beijing Jiaotong University (China) and second Doctoral degree in Geography from the University of Cambridge (United Kingdom).

My research tries to investigate complex dynamic urban systems, primarily using agent-based modelling and big data. This is involved in several urban sub-systems, including transportation, land use, environment, energy, economy and population systems. Some specific research topics are as follows: 

•	Activity-based Travel Demand Modelling

•	Integrated Land Use and Transport Model

•	Smart Cities (e.g., Smart Mobility, Smart Home and Smart Grid)

•	Social Network Analysis and Modelling

•	Adoption of Electric Vehicle and Autonomous Vehicle

•	Domestic Energy Consumption

For those researchers (e.g., PhD students and post-docs) who want to join my team, please feel free to contact me (chengxiang.zhuge@polyu.edu.hk) with your CV included.
